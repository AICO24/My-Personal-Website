                    <h4> HTML </h4>
                    <p>For me, I can learn it easily because I had a subject in it during my senior high school, and it is also very easy to learn compared to other languages, and I know how to do projects easily.</p>

                    <h4> CSS </h4>
                    <p>I'll be honest with myself about this language because since I've been studying it and I don't have much experience yet, it's still hard for me to design when I have a project to do, but I'm exploring and doing advanced studies so that at the end of the day there's something new I can discover.</p>

                    <h4> JavaScript </h4>
                    <p>This language is a very interesting lesson for me because, in my senior high school, many of my classmates really enjoy coding when it's related to this language, even though it's a bit difficult to learn, especially for beginners when they come to the IT course.</p>

                    <p>What I can say here is that it is not difficult to learn when you are a logical person when it comes to problem solving during your lessons, and for me to be honest, I find it difficult to learn because I lack logical experience, but I can improve myself in this language.</p>
